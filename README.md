# file-preview-page

Ever wanted to quickly share files with someone, but the server did not support directory listings ? Worry Not.

This little package can quickly generate a directory listing which can be then deployed alongwith the files to make it easy to share files over free public hosting spaces like surge.sh, vercel, netlify, firebase or even your own server.
